Running the Game
------------------
The game should be cross platform, and is tested on Ubuntu Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. However,
in order to run the game as script, you will need to install:
 - Python 2.7: http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/

 - Pygame (v1.9.1 or compatible):  http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
 		- For windows, you should download pygame-1.9.2a0.win32-py2.7.msi
		- For mac lion, you should download pygame-1.9.2pre-py2.7-macosx10.7.mpkg.zip
		- For mac leopard, you should download pygame-1.9.2pre-py2.6-macosx10.6.mpkg.zip

Source Code Explanation (For Homework!)
-----------------------
The only two files that are related to compute the probability of the game are: Auto1.py and Auto2.py
The source code should be easy to understand as comments are properly in place.
